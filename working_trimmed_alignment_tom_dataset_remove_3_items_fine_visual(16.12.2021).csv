We highly recommend you that use a laptop/computer desktop, and Google Chrome browser to answer this study. 
Now please read the following information before starting the study.

 

What is the purpose of this study? 

The purpose of this study is to investigate your social responses while watching a series of videos, and your intuitive judgements on questions where there may be no single “correct” answer, and your answers on a variety of scenarios.



What does this study involve? 

Your participation in this study may last up to 90 minutes. You will expected to complete a questionnaire containing twelve different types of questions and these may be multiple choice or free choice.



To ensure the quality of survey data, your responses will be subject to sophisticated statistical control methods. Responding without much effort will be flagged for low-quality data. Though you will receive payment regardless of your data quality, please note that your honest and thoughtful responses are important to us and to the study. 

 

Other important items you should know



Benefits from participation: You will receive US$8???? for participating in this study. Additionally, you may experience indirect benefits (e.g. learning more about experimental psychology).





Risks associated with participation: Whilst participating in this study, you will encounter no greater risks of discomfort than found in routine daily activities.





Withdrawing from the study: Participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may choose to stop your participation at any time. You can also withdraw all or part of your data up to one month after participation by contacting the researchers (see below for contact details).





Data collection: The data collected in this study will include your responses in all sections of the survey, as well as basic demographic information. The data collected will be used only for the purpose described in this form. The raw data will only be available to the principal investigator listed in this consent form and other personnel involved in this study at the University of Birmingham and the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil.  During the data collection process, the data will be stored on Qualtrics' secure servers. When the data collection is complete, data will be stored on a secure computer. Once the study is complete, a copy of the anonymised data may be made available to journals to publish on their website to accompany publications arising from this study. Fully anonymised datasets may be shared with other researchers according to open access data sharing agreements. Data gathered from this study will be maintained as long as required by regulations: up to 10 years following the publication of empirical articles or communications describing the results of the study.





Confidentiality: Every effort will be taken to protect the names of the participants in this study. Your identity will not be recorded as part of your data, and will not be revealed in any publication that may result from this study; your consent form will not be stored with your data, to ensure that your identity cannot be linked in any way to your data. All information you provide will be kept confidential, except as governed by law.
